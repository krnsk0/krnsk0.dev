description: "A multi-user real-time editor for animated sprites and pixel art based on Socket IO and React. Built in two weeks with a four-person team using only functional components (to learn the Hooks syntax). Implements a hand-rolled state management system. Went through several rounds of profiling to identify and remove rendering & performance bottlenecks. Exports animated GIFs."
