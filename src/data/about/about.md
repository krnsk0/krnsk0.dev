title: "I'm <b>Jon Kurinsky</b>, a Chicago-based software developer relocating to <b>Philadelphia</b> or <b>Denver</b>."

<p>I'm a builder of tools and a solver of problems. I believe in writing human-friendly, declarative code.</p>
<p>After self-teaching Python to automate my job in logistics within the publishing industry, I fell in love with programming.</p>
<p>I turned to Fullstack Academy, a bootcamp program in Chicago, to help me transition from hobbyist to professional. There, I became proficient with a Javascript-based stack: <b>Node</b>, <b>Express</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Redux</b>, <b>PostgresSQL</b>, and <b>Sequelize</b>.
</p>
<p>I enjoy the immediacy and interactivity of frontend development. Getting to know the React ecosystem and the challenges involved in writing clean, lightweight, and maintainable code for the browser has been a blast.
</p>
<p>But I've also been captivated by the problem space of scalable, performant server architecture, especially for real-time applications, and I'm hoping to expand my exposure to  backend development.</p>
