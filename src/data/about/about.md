<p>After teaching myself python on the job to automate media processing tasks, I shifted into software development. Since 2018, I've led a frontend team at a Fortune 50, worked on web performance and A/B testing at a global e-commerce giant, and helped an ed-tech video startup transform its technology stack to scale for a new period of growth.</p>

<p>As a collaborative over-communicator who loves to act as a force multiplier, I firmly believe that software is a team sport. I'm a generalist most experienced with Typescript, React, Node, and GraphQL, but will learn the right tool for the job. I have some specialization in front-end architecture, web video and audio APIs, Node microservices, and media processing.</p>

<p>I'm especially interested in problems related to media delivery, media playback, and real-time collaboration-- and I'm ready to go deeper into these areas on a mature team with a growth and continuous-learning mindset.</p>
