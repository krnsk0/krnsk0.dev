<p>I'm a builder of tools and a solver of problems. I believe in writing human-friendly, declarative code.</p>
<p>After self-teaching <b>Python</b> to automate my job in logistics within the publishing industry, I fell in love with software development.</p>
<p>I turned to Fullstack Academy, a bootcamp program in Chicago, to help me navigate a transition into the tech industry, proper. There, I became proficient with a Javascript-based stack: <b>Node</b>, <b>Express</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Redux</b>, <b>PostgresSQL</b>, and <b>Sequelize</b>.
</p>
<p>Since then, I've worked on business-critical frontend applications with millions of users, developer tooling to help teams magnify their productivity, and resources to help teach the Javacript and Node ecosystems.</p>
</p>
<p>I have a special interest in problems of <b>frontend architecture</b>: the design of complex client-side applications that are performant, maintainable, testable, and scalable. I have experience using the <b>microfrontend</b> pattern to solve problems in this area.</p>
